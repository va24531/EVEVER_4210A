EPEVER Tracer 4210AN with RS485 Install On Linux

Key Note - Port speed is 115200, 8,N,1   - NOT 8,E,1


Python 3

mbpoll -> https://github.com/epsilonrt/mbpoll

Have to get Linux to see USB / RS485 Adapter as what it really is -> CH343   ->https://github.com/WCHSoftGroup/ch343ser_linux

When plugged in, you get /dev/ttyCH343USB0, and that works.


Need to upgrade Node.js to newer version for Node-Red to install, and install newest version of Node-Red (or a fresh node-red install.) in order to use Modbus

Copied souce code for Node-Red from    ->  https://github.com/AdamWelchUK/NodeRedEPEverDashboard
Modified port settings and was done testing


Other little tid-bits;

*make sure to set current date/time with MT50, otherwise daily/month/yearly values will be off
